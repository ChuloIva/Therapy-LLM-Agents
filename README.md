# Therapy-LLM-Agents

**Overview of the Script**

This script uses the CrewAI framework to analyze a therapy session transcript and generate detailed psychological reports. It employs multiple AI agents, each specializing in a specific aspect of analysis, to perform the following tasks:

- **Topic Segmentation**: Breaks down the client's text into distinct general topics for easier understanding.
- **Cognitive Dissonance Analysis**: Identifies contradictions or biases in the client's thinking patterns.
- **Emotional Trauma Analysis**: Detects underlying emotional traumas or core psychological issues affecting the client.
- **Plan Generation**: Develops actionable plans to address the identified cognitive and emotional issues.
- **Summary Compilation**: Combines all findings into a comprehensive summary report.

The agents work sequentially, utilizing a language model to process the transcript and produce structured JSON outputs for each task. This automated approach aims to assist therapists or clients by providing in-depth insights and practical steps for healing.
